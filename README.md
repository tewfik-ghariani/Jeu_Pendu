This is a mini game called Hangman written in bash!


A word is randomly selected from the "minidico.txt" file and its length is displayed.

The user should enter only one character, if this character is in this word, all its occurrences will be displayed and the number of attempts remains the same,
Otherwise, the number of possible attempts decreases,
The user wins if he/she guesses all the chosen characters. Otherwise if the number of attempts reaches 0 without finding the word, the player is declared a loser.


Enjoy:)
